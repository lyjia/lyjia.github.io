# Remixes and Original Music

I've been making music with computers, off-and-on, since I was a teenager. I generally produce under the names **Lyjia** or **couchl0ck**, and have been known to DJ as **Lyjia**. These are some of my favorites creations:

# Synthesizer Presets

Synth programming is an occasional hobby. Some of those designs are posted here:

# Recording and Foley

I sometimes record interesting things and post them online. The following *free* sample packs are available on freesound.org, and licensed as CreativeCommons:
