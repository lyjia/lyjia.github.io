Tom Corelis: Just another dude from [SoCal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGkuxk-LPww){:target="_blank"}, shouting into the wind to anyone that will listen. Welcome!

Some interesting things about me:
* I hold a B.S. in Global Business Management from [California State University: San Marcos](https://csusm.edu/){:target="_blank"} and an A.A.S in Liberal Arts and Sciences from [Palomar College](https://www.palomar.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
* I also spent a year studying abroad at [Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences](http://www.amsterdamuas.com/){:target="_blank"}, in the Business & Economic Studies program.
* Despite those credentials, my real passion is computers! I have been programming since I was a child and breaking/fixing them for even longer.
* I am an [Eagle Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)){:target="_blank"} and was co-awarded the BSA Honor Medal for heroism.
* Many, many moons ago, I was a staff contributor at [DailyTech.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DailyTech){:target="_blank"} and wrote many technology news and stories for them. A handful of my articles have been cited in books and research articles.
